      A list of "back translations" of the target. For example, source words
      that the target can translate to.

      The list is guaranteed to contain the source word that was requested
      (e.g., if the source word being

      looked up is "fly", then it is guaranteed that "fly" will be in the
      backTranslations list).

      However, it is not guaranteed to be in the first position, and often will
      not be.

      A value between 0.0 and 1.0 which represents the "confidence"

      (or perhaps more accurately, "probability in the training data") of that

      1.0.

      A string giving the term in the target language and in a form best suited

      for end-user display. Generally, this will only differ from the
      normalizedTarget

      in terms of capitalization. For example, a proper noun like "Juan" will
      have

      normalizedTarget = "juan" and displayTarget = "Juan".

    summary: >-
      A string giving the word to display as a prefix of the translation.
      Currently,

      this is the gendered determiner of nouns, in languages that have gendered
      determiners.

      For example, the prefix of the Spanish word "mosca" is "la", since "mosca"
      is a feminine noun in Spanish.

      This is only dependent on the translation, and not on the source.

      If there is no prefix, it will be the empty string.
