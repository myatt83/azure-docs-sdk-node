    summary: >-
      The administrators of this
      [NotificationHook](xref:@azure/ai-metrics-advisor.NotificationHook).

      Administrators have total control over a NotificationHook, being allowed
      to update or delete.

      Each element in this list represents a user with administrator access, but
      the value of each `string` element

      depends on the type of authentication to be used by this administrator
      when communicating with the service.

      If
      [MetricsAdvisorKeyCredential](xref:@azure/ai-metrics-advisor.MetricsAdvisorKeyCredential)
      authentication will be used, the `string` must be the user's email
      address.

      If AAD authentication will be used instead, the `string` must uniquely
      identify the user's principal.

      For instance, for a `ClientSecretCredential`, the `string` must be the
      client ID.
