    summary: >-
      The `AbortSignal` associated with the operation being retried on.

      If this signal is fired during the wait time between retries, then the
      `retry()` method will ensure that the wait is abandoned and the retry
      process gets cancelled. If this signal is fired when the operation is in
      progress, then the operation is expected to react to it.
